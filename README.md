# ClassySeatGenerator
This is a simple website to generate a random seating arrangement for students in a classroom.
It's made with Django and has basic features like adding students, classrooms and rearranging chairs (through the admin page).
Made on demand for my math teacher. Will be published on a domain soon (to run it locally, you can download the code, create and activate a virutal environement, install django and type python migrate.py runserver).
